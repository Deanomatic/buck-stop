# Installations and other requirements for running the app
* First fork this project to your repo and then clone it down to your machine.
## API keys
* This project uses Firebase as the database. You will need to set up a new project in Firebase and use your own key. Once you get your own key place it in the /app/FBCreds.js file to give the app access to Firebase. 
* You will also need a google maps API key. Simply go to the [Google developer site](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key) and request a key. Place this key mapAPI.js to conceal your key just like the FBCreds.js file.
## The Installations
* Just run `npm install` in your terminal and it will install all dependencies needed.
* If you don't have npm, get npm.
* Start up a local server and get into the app.
